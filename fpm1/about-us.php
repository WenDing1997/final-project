        <p> Having retired from careers in agriculture, Jeff and Sallee wanted to share
        their love of the outdoors and nature along with the great variety of activities our region has to offer.
        Son and daughter-in-law Kurt and Megan wanted to use their skills and talents to create a future brewing
        great beer for others to enjoy, as well as, provide an avenue for activities and events. </p>

        <p> The brewery and tasting room is located in the Town of Sumerhill, just off
          scenic NYS Rte. 90; a small rural setting rich in history. Striving to be an
          asset to our agricultural community, we utilize our own estate grown fruit,
          herbs and hops as well as other local products when possible. Sustainable
          practices include renewable energy and water conservation. Fresh local ingredients inspire our ales and seasonal brews.</p>

        <p> We invite you to come enjoy our brews, relax and have some fun. Our destination is worth the trip up the hill!!</p>
