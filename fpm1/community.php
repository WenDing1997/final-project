          We take our commitment to the local community seriously. Our own homegrown
          organic hops make up about 40% of what goes in our beer. We also grow our
          own Rhubarb, Blueberries, Strawberries and Pumpkin. For everything else,
          we try to go to neighboring farms. That doesnâ€™t just mean getting the
          best ingredients, it means helping the entire community thrive. Here are
          some of our local supply farms:

    <h3>About Summerhill, NY</h3>
    <div id="sub-div3">
      <p>
        We are located in Summerhill, NY, a beautiful town in Cayuga County, northeast
        of Ithaca. This are was once occupied by the Onondaga people in the early 1700s.
        Originally named Locke, this town has become Summerhill since 1832 due to
        a name conflict with another Locke located west of Summerhill.
        Summerhill boasts spectacular scenery and fresh air, and it is truly a
        wonderful place where you can take a step back from the dense corners
        of the metropolitan world. We are proud to be in Summerhiill with its long history
        and we invite you to join our community!
